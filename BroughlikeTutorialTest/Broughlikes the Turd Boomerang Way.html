		<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
		
		<p>
			Welcome to my tutorial!<br/>
			This is my first tutorial, which I am writing at the request of my friend Sapazu.<br/>
			Each section will contain an explanation of the required steps, followed by a code snippet with comments.<br/>
			My example project was built in GameMaker Studio 1.6, so the sample code is written in GML, similar to javascript.<br/>
			There is not enough information here to recreate my project from scratch, but I hope the ideas are explained in such a way that you can go on to create your own game in this style.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="step1">Step 1: Generating a Map</h3>
		
		
		<p>
			Broughlikes take place in a series of small, randomly generated square maps.<br/>
			These maps contain a grid of spaces, subdivided by a random configuration of walls.<br/>
			Each map will contain a player, an exit door, and some number of monsters.<br/>
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Create a 5 x 5 grid of spaces, and store a reference to each space in a 2d array.</li>
			<li>Add an outward-facing walls to the spaces at either end of each row or column.</li>
			<li>Determine a start position for the player. For my example, I will use one of the four corners of the map.</li>
			<li>Determine the location of the exit portal. For my example, I will use the corner opposite the player.</li>

//The top-right corner of the map on-screen will be (64, 64)

var player_start_i = irandom(1)*4; //Horizontal space is either 0 or 4
var player_start_j = irandom(1)*4; //Vertical space is either 0 or 4

//The escape portal will start in the corner opposite to the player
var escape_i = abs(player_start_i - 4);
var escape_j = abs(player_start_j - 4);

//Spaces will be 128 x 128 sprites

		<h3 id="step2">Step 2. The Pathfinding Algorithm</h3>
		
		<p>
			I use a modified version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">a*</a> pathfinding algorithm
			to determine the shortest path between spaces on the map.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We will create a function named "build_a_star" which takes a single "start space" as an argument.<br/>
			It will create a 2d array with the same dimensions as the map.<br/>
			Each cell will contain a number, corresponding to the number of spaces away it is from the start space.
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Create a 2d array named "a_star" with the same dimensions as the map (5 x 5).</li>
			<li>Assign each cell in the array a null value. After we are done, any spaces that are still NULL are inaccessible from the pathfinding start point.</li>
			<li>Call the "assign_a_star" helper function, to assign the start space a value of 0, and recursively assign values to all other connected spaces.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p><details>
				<summary>Code from the build_a_star function:</summary>
				<pre><code>
//build_a_star(space)

// global.a_star is a 2d array, the same size as global.map. Using a given starting space,
// this assigns a number to each space, representing the distance away from the start.

// We can use this for map-building and pathfinding.

var space = argument0;
var coords = get_map_coordinates_from_space(space);

// Clear the a_star array.
// Some spaces may be inaccessible due to wall placement. If this is the case, we want
// to overwrite the old value with "noone"
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i += 1)
{
    for (var j = 0; j &lt; 5; j += 1)
    {
        global.a_star[i, j] = noone;
    }
}

// The starting space is 0 spaces away from itself.
// This function will ALSO assign values to the surrounding spaces, recursively filling the whole map.
assign_a_star_distance(coords[0], coords[1], 0);
				</code></pre>
			</details></p>
		
		<p>The "assign_a_star_distance" helper function will take a pair of corrdinates and a value as input, and will perform the following steps:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Find the a_star array cell corresponding to the input coordinates.</li>
			<li>If the cell contains a NULL value, assign it the new input value.</li>
			<li>If the cell already contains a value, assign it the new value <i>only</i> if the new value is less than the current value.</li>
			<li>
				Call assign_a_star_distance for each accessible adjacent space to assign the same value + 1.<br/>
				If we found a space that is 3 spaces away from the start, we can deduce that each adjacent space that is not separated by a wall and does not already have a value must be 4 spaces away from the start.
			</li>
		</ol>

    // If this is not the last space in the row/column in either direction,

		<p>Since your map does not currently have any interior walls, if you call build_a_star with the center space as the start space, the a_star array should look like this:</p>
		<p>
			<code><pre>
[
	[4, 3, 2, 3, 4],
	[3, 2, 1, 2, 3],
	[2, 1, 0, 1, 2],
	[3, 2, 1, 2, 3],
	[4, 3, 2, 3, 4]
]
			</code></pre>
		</p>
		
		<p>Notice how the corner spaces are 4 orthogonal moves from the center space.</p>

		<h3 id="step3">Step 3. Adding Random Walls</h3>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Create a list of every location where a wall could be generated. There are 40 locations in total.<br/>
			A vertical wall could exist between each space in all 5 columns, and a horizontal wall could exist between each space in all 5 rows.<br/>
			In my implementation, I store each location as a pair of spaces.<br/></li>
			<img src="GenerateMap2.png"/>
			<li>Shuffle the list of wall locations.</li>
			<li>Add a random wall to the map.</li> 
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
				<li>Get the first item in the wall locations list.</li>
				<li>Create a wall object in the specified location.</li>
				<li>Remove the location from the list.</li>
				<li>Build the a_star pathfinding array, with the center space as the starting point.</li>
				<li>
					If the space on either side of the new wall has a pathfinding value of NULL, that means that the new wall has subdivided the map, and some spaces are not accessible.<br/>
					If this is the case, delete the new wall, and repeat step 3 in its entirety.<br/>
					In the example below, note that NULL == -4 in GML.
				</li>
				<p><img src="RandomWall1.png"/></p>
			</ol>
			<li>
				Repeat step 3 until you have your desired number of walls. For my example, I will generate between 4 and 8 walls per map.<br/>
				Beware: If you are generating a lot of walls on a small map, it is possible that you will run out of valid locations before you are done building random walls.
			</li>

			<p><details>
				<summary>Code from the add_random_wall function</summary>
				<pre><code>
// If there is at least 1 valid wall location on our list
if ds_list_size(global.wall_locations) > 0
{
    // Add a wall to the first location on the list.
    // (It was shuffled when we created it, so this should be random.)
    
    var location = ds_list_find_value(global.wall_locations, 0);
    
    var wall = add_wall_between_spaces(location[0], location[1]);
    
    // Create the pathfinding map
    build_a_star(global.map[2, 2]);
    
    var valid = true;
    
    // Check the spaces on either side of the new wall.
    // If either space has been completely blocked off from the rest of the map, this wall location is no good.
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 2; i += 1)
    {
        var coords = get_map_coordinates_from_space(location[i]);
        if (global.a_star[coords[0], coords[1]] == noone)

            valid = false;

    {
        with (wall) { instance_destroy(); }
        add_random_wall();
    }
}

		<h3 id="step4">Step 4. Adding Monsters</h3>
		
		<p>
			In my example, each room will be more challenging than the last.<br/>
			I will have 3 types of monsters. They will all share the same behavior, but will have different art and different amounts of starting health.<br/>
			I will use a persistent "Monster Manager" class that will track the number of levels that the player has cleared,
			and will determine the number and level of the monsters that appear in each room.<br/>
			I will not cover that process in detail in this tutorial, but the end result is a "monsters_array" that is generated when the player arrives in a new room.<br/>
			The "monsters_array" is an array of integers. The number of elements determines the number of monsters, and each item determines the level of that particular monster.<br/>
			For instance, an array that looks like this <code>[1, 1, 1, 2, 3]</code> would spawn 3 level-1 monsters, a level-2 monster, and a level-3 monster.<br/>
		</p>
		
		<p>We will create a function called "create_monsters_on_random_spaces", which will take the mosnters_array as input. It will follow the following steps:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Build the pathfinding array, with the player's current space as the starting point.</li>
			<li>
				Make a list of every space with a pathfinding value of 3 or greater. In the interest of fairness, we don't want to generate a monster less than 3 spaces away from the player.<br/>
				Beware: If you are generating a lot of monsters on a small map, you may run out of valid spawn locations.</li>
			<li>Shuffle the list of monster locations.</li>
			<li>
				For each entry in the monsters_array, pick the next space in the list and add a monster of the appropriate level.<br/>
				In the example below, the monsters array = <code>[1, 1, 1, 2]</code>:
			</li>
